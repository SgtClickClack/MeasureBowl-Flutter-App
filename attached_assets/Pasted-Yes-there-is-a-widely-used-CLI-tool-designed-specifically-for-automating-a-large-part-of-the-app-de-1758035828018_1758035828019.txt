Yes, there is a widely-used CLI tool designed specifically for automating a large part of the app deployment process. It's called **Fastlane**.

While it's not a single magic command that does *everything* out of the box, once configured, it allows you to automate almost every step of the deployment process with simple CLI commands.

### What is Fastlane? 🚀

**Fastlane** is an open-source tool suite that automates the tedious parts of deploying mobile apps. Think of it as an automated assistant for releasing your app. Instead of manually building the app, taking screenshots, uploading to the app store consoles, and filling out forms, you write a script to do it all for you.

For your "MeasureBowl" app, this would be the perfect tool to manage future updates.

### What Can It Automate?

Fastlane can handle the entire release process for both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

  * ✅ **Build the App:** It can run the necessary `flutter build` commands for both Android (`appbundle`) and iOS (`ipa`).
  * ✅ **Manage Code Signing (iOS):** It automatically handles the complex process of creating and managing the certificates and provisioning profiles required by Apple.
  * ✅ **Upload to Testers:** It can upload your builds directly to **TestFlight** for iOS beta testers and to **Google Play Internal Testing** for Android testers.
  * ✅ **Manage Screenshots & Metadata:** It can automatically capture screenshots for different device sizes and languages and upload them to your store listings. It can also update your app's description, release notes, and other metadata.
  * ✅ **Submit for Review:** It can automatically upload the final build and submit it for review to both stores.

### How Does it Work?

You configure Fastlane using a file in your project called a `Fastfile`. This file contains different "lanes," which are essentially scripts for different tasks.

For example, you could create a lane called `deploy_beta` that does the following:

1.  Increments the app's version number.
2.  Builds the iOS and Android versions of the app.
3.  Uploads the builds to TestFlight and Google Play Internal Testing.
4.  Sends a Slack message to your team that a new beta is available.

You would then run this entire sequence from your terminal with a single command:

```bash
fastlane deploy_beta
```

While the initial setup requires some time to configure everything correctly (like connecting to your developer accounts), it saves an enormous amount of time and prevents human error in the long run. It is the industry-standard tool for mobile app deployment automation.
